So, we did put DCGAN in touchdesigner. It's a media artist's primary tool. 
Being written in python, it supports tensorflow models. So much fun!

If you want to launch this on your computer, 
install `tensorflow-gpu==1.4.0` in a virtual environment, then add it to `sys.path` in touchdesigner.
Also, install `CUDA 8` and `cudnn6` and add it to `os.environ` in touchdesigner.
