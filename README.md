So, we did put https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow in touchdesigner. It's a media artist's primary tool. 
Being written in python, it supports tensorflow models. So much fun!
Inspired by https://github.com/exsstas/StyleTransfer-in-TD


If you want to launch this on your computer, 
install `tensorflow-gpu==1.4.0` in a virtual environment, then add it to `sys.path` in touchdesigner.
Also, install `CUDA 8` and `cudnn6` and add it to `os.environ` in touchdesigner.

There are some pre-trained nets at http://nips4creativity.com/,
drop me an email for more.

Good luck!
